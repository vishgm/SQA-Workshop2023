# Automating Software tests using Selenium (Python)

## About :

This folder contains code to test Selenium for Web browser Automation using python

<a name="libraries"></a>

## Libraries:

```
selenium, time
```

## Installation:

1. Open any IDE and create a new Python file.
2. Install the Selenium package by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Next, download and install the appropriate web driver for your preferred browser.
   For example, if using Chrome, you can download the ChromeDriver from the following link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

4. Now, run any of the test Python file present in the tests directory

5. Finally, after running the code, observe the browser window as it automatically navigates to the Google website, enters a search query for "your search term", submits the query, and then closes the browser window.

6. By running this simple demo, you can get a hands-on experience of using Selenium to automate a basic test case. Feel free to experiment with modifying the code to perform other actions on a website, such as clicking on links or filling out forms.
